CtrlSpeak's welcome window doubles as a quick tour—watch the intro, then enjoy rotating tidbits while models download.
The Whisper small and large-v3 models live under your CtrlSpeak AppData folder, keeping the install footprint lightweight.
Holding the right Ctrl key records audio—release it to transcribe and paste the text wherever you're typing.
You can swap between CPU and GPU inference anytime from the Manage CtrlSpeak window's device panel.
